## Is it Possible to Use Least Squares Linear Regression for the Function $y = ax^2 + bx + c\sin(dx) + e$



Given function, $y = ax^2 + bx + c\sin(x) + d$, is nonlinear with respect to $x$. However, the function can be linearized with respect to its parameters $a, b,$ and $c$. 

For the function $y= ax^2+bx+c\sin(dx)+e$, things can get tricky.

### Linearizing with Known $d$:

If $d$ is known, the terms in the function can be considered as separate features or predictors:

1. $x^2$ is $feature1$
2. $x$ is $feature2$
3. $\sin(dx)$ is $feature3$

For known $d$, we can set up a linear regression model as:

$y =$ $a$ $\times$ $feature1$ + $b$ $\times$ $feature2$ + $c$ $\times$ $feature3$ + $e$

### For Unknown $d$:

If $d$ is unknown, the problem becomes nonlinear with respect to $ d$. Linear regression techniques won't work directly in estimating \$d$. Instead, we would have to employ nonlinear regression methods.
