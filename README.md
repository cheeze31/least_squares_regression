# Investigation on Least Squares Linear Regression

I read a few papers to investigate the derivation for least squares regression, then used Python to see how it could be applied to find different lines of best fit. See links below:

- [Linear Functions](https://github.com/cheeze31/least_squares_regression/blob/main/Line_regression%20(2).ipynb)
- [Polynomial Functions](https://github.com/cheeze31/least_squares_regression/blob/main/parabola_regression%20(3).ipynb)
- [Polynomial Functions With Trigonometric Elements](https://github.com/cheeze31/least_squares_regression/blob/main/sin_parabola_regression%20(1).ipynb)
